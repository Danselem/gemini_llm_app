The largest asteroid in the solar system is **(1) Ceres**.

**Summary:**

Ceres is a dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Discovered in 1801, it was initially classified as a planet, then an asteroid, and finally reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Ceres is approximately 940 km (584 miles) in diameter and accounts for about a third of the asteroid belt's total mass. It's unique among asteroids due to its near-spherical shape, suggesting it achieved hydrostatic equilibrium at some point. NASA's Dawn spacecraft orbited Ceres from 2015 to 2018, revealing a complex surface with evidence of past water ice, briny liquid beneath the surface, and bright salt deposits in craters like Occator. These discoveries have made Ceres a key target for understanding the early solar system and the potential for water-bearing bodies in the asteroid belt.
